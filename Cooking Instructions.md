3. Break the egg into the frying pan, add a pinch of salt, and cook it for 4 to 5 minutes until the yolk is partially set.

4. Take your toasts and spread butter on them.

5. Put one slice of ham on each toast.

6. Put one slice of cheese on top of each ham slice.

7. Put the fried egg on top of one of the toasts.
